      <h2 class="about">Why I do What I Does</h2>
      	<p>Picture this, Spring days have come and gone. No longer do cool breezes blow though the backyard while you are working in the garden. Yes, the time of year has come in the South when a cool rain shower leaves you in a sticky, sweaty sauna for the rest of the day. The heat and humidity stick to your skin like spiderwebs. Just when it seems there is no relief for the miserable heat you come across an intriguing recipe for Lynchburg Lemonade. A drink that you know will bring down the tempurature, but it has a slight twist that you have never seen before. After you gather up ingredients, and prepare your drink, you find a spot under the shade tree, and relax while your drink allows you to find salvation from the "dog days of summer". This website is the source of your relief for those gruesome summer days, as well as every other day of the year.</p>
		<p>I have composed this website to bring to you the best recipes for Southern cuisine and drinks because I know how important food and alcohol are to the Southern way of life. Every month, I provide you with two new recipes; one classic cuisine recipe, and a monthly recipe for a seasonal mixed drink. Each recipe has been handed down through generations. Indeed, only time has been able to perfect the combinations of ingredients and flavors, and I have brought them right to you for your personal enjoyment.</p>
		<p>Thanks for joining in. Please enjoy this month's enstallment, and remember to come back next month for more timeless Southern classics. </p>

In 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced the drink the Washington, D.C., and it immediately gained popularity in the White House. In the year, 1983, The Mint Julep became the official drink of the Kentucky Derby.</p>
